            <h2>Ado</h2>
            <p>Ado is an utaite who began her activities on January 10, 2017 at the age of 14. In late 2020,
                 she exploded onto the music scene with her debut release of "USSEEWA" Nvat just 17 years old.
                  As of Sep 2023, it has over 296 million views on YouTube, and over 6.5 million plays with over 
                  twenty-five thousand mylists on Niconico. Since then, Ado has been garnering lots of attention 
                  when releasing new covers or original music and she also releases albums of her covered songs as well.</p>
            <p>Ado has a versatile voice and is able to add power to it. Her vocals, seeming somewhat mature for her age, usually 
                give off an angsty vibe, as of a rebellious teenager especially in some of her original and cover songs like "Show" 
                and "Crime & Punishment," where she best utilizes it.</p>
            <p>She uses growls to inject a gravelly angst into her voice but can also belt a soft and clear falsetto on a dime. 
                Not only that, her vocal range itself aside from her techniques is astounding; displayed in "God-ish" to its
                 fullest extent, Ado's latest measure of vocal range is from a low and rumbling fried B2 banging all the way 
                 up through to an ear-piercing screaming C7.</p>
